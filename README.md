# Pushups Counter
### A personal project to further my development skills 

This app is aimed for me to get better at web development as well as fulfill his needs. 

I wanted to track my daily push-ups, see the progress I have made, the stats (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), have the ability to look in the past, get rewards for surpassing certain milestones or creating my own challenges. 

Still haven't found an iOS/web app that does it all. 

###The beginning

So I decided to make one! I'm a **front-end web developer**, so it's a web application (hopefully soon to be a PWA) written in React deployed via Netlify. I'm also using FaunaDB as storage accessed using serverless Netlify functions. 

Just to get running fast, this repo comes from an example of a FaunaDB connection with Netlify functions. 

### State

Now, it's just an app exclusively useful for me. It's conneted to my database, stored in my Netlify account with no defined URL. You can run your own instance and publish it on your own server. 

The plan is to make the app available to the public, sign in with an account (auth with Netlify Identity/Auth0) and use it.

### The future, the vision, the goal!

Right now, I'm still working on the basic features, such as tracking push-ups, displaying them and showing the stats(!). 

But further on I would really like to move with this project forward to some dashboard of accomplishments, habits, tasks and so much more, that would be useful for me.

Goals for further development: 
- See the progress of a project in % (be it a book, web app, home renovations, etc.)
- Statistics of read articles on Pocket via API
- Habit tracking (daily/weekly/monthly)

Coding goals:
- Rewriting the app to Typescript
- Rewriting the example Netlify functions

You can see all the progress, tasks and everything else in the "Projects" section of this repo on GitHub.

###End

Oh, and please excuse my design skills. I'm a crazy person that throws all the colors in there, so it will be moderated with time. Thanks!
